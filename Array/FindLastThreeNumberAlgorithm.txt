Find largest three number in array.

1) Initialize the largest three elements as minus infinite.
    first = second = third = -âˆž

2) Iterate through all elements of array.
   a) Let current array element be x.
   b) If (x > first)
      {
          // This order of assignment is important
          third = second
          second = first
          first = x   
       }
   c)  Else if (x > second and x != first)
      {
          third = second
          second = x 
      }
   d)  Else if (x > third and x != second)
      {
          third = x  
      }

3) Print first, second and third.
